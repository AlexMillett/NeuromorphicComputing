<h1>Cancer Cell Detection Project</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
There is no code in this repository as I dont own the code, and can't clone it to my Github.  For this Job we used reinforcemnet learning using physical outputs such as voltage and currents as weights to try and train a physical structure of resin and nanowire.  Other weights that were used in our training were length of exposure to X voltage and X current, nanowire per square cm, and resin density.  This project was unique as it combined machine learning, deep learning, hardware interfacing, data refining, and system measurement techniques to train a hardware neural network rather than a software.  While we had many successes in the year and half that I lead the project, we were never able to train the XOR logic gate into the system meaning deep learning in our system is not yet feasable.
